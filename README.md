# iMenu
## An easier way to navigate iframes

iMenu is very simple and open sourced and what it does is create a little menu button at the top right at all you have to do to initiate it is to put: | new ifrMenu("YOUR IFRAME ID").init() | and that's all. Also, the div that the entire menu is in has the ID of iMenu.
